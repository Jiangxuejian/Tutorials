    "# Basic Reduction of a Single Observation Using the SMURF pol2map Command\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to run a basic, standard reduction of a SCUBA-2 POL-2 dataset using the Starlink software suite. The basic command we will use is [`pol2map`](http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun258.htx/sun258.html?xref_POL2MAP) in [`SMURF`](http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/docs/sun258.htx/sun258.html). We will have to run this command twice: first to generate the Q and U timestreams, as well as an initial unpolarized intensity map. Secondly . we run the command again with a different invocation, to generate better masks and to produce the output Q, U and I maps as well as the final vector catalogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the results produced may improve with subsequent Starlink releases, the command invocation is not expected to change significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further background and details on the material covered in this tutorial, please consult the [`POL-2 Cookbook`](http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/docs/sc22.htx/sc22.html) which is also included in your Starlink software installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding further you should ensure the Starlink software is loaded in your terminal, and you have loaded package `smurf`. You will need to replace the path in `export STARLINK_DIR` below with the location of your Starlink installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also remove any previous pol2map settings that exist in your default `ADAM_USER` directory (`~/adam/`)."
