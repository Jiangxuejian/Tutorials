    "# Calculating fluxes from SCUBA-2 maps\n",
    "\n",
    "One common task JCMT scientists carry out is estimating the dust mass or column density from the emission in a SCUBA-2 map. To do this, it is necessary to calculate the 850um dust flux of an object/field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "In general there are numerous scientific subtleties to which type of photometry is most appropriate for a given situation. Point sources are probably the most straight forward, followed by cases where you can integrate over an entire large area. The common (for galactic scientists) case of having extended structure throughout a large map, and hoping to break it down into separate structures lends itself to a clumpfinding approach, a filament finding approach or attempting to convert your map into hierarchical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will just quickly demonstrate some of the simpler cases and how to use Starlink software to calculate these. It is not a guide to which approach is appropriate for which scientific investigations, and it does not address the underlying uncertainties in these approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up starlink\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we have to set up Starlink and KAPPA as normal. We will also create a working directory and change into it, and ensure that Starlink won't try and prompt us for any values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You should replace the `/star` in the first line below with the location of your Starlink installation directory: e.g. `~/star-2018A`)"

    "## Calibration units\n",
    "SCUBA-2 maps are normally calibrated by our pipeline into units of either mJy/beam or mJy/arcsec$^2$. If you need more detail on the calibration process, please see [Dempsey et al 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.430.2534D/abstract), or our webpages at https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/continuum/scuba-2/calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Point sources\n",
    "If you want to find the flux of a point source, you would normally calibrate your map in units of Jy/beam. Each point source corresponds to one beam, and therefore the peak value in the source will tell you the total flux density of the source. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we are going to use a calibrator observation of the bright point source CRL618, in the file `Data/jcmts20191022_00059_850_reduced001_nit_000.sdf`. You can download this file from CADC at this link [here](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/data/pub/JCMT/jcmts20191022_00059_850_reduced001_nit_000.fits?RUNID=eaotutorial), or you can go to the JCMT Archive at CADC and download a reduced calibrator observation of your choice. If you download a file from the archive, you'll need to convert it from FITS format to NDF (see [`fits2ndf`](http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun55.htx/sun55.html?xref_FITS2NDF) in the `CONVERT` package), and please ensure it is a point source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to see what units your map is currently in. We can use the KAPPA command `ndftrace` to do this. (Here we have also used the shell command `head` to only show the first 10 lines)."
